# Apartment Search - Frontend Integration Guide

## Overview

The Apartment Search backend provides a **semantic search engine** for apartment listings that understands natural language queries. Unlike keyword search, it understands meaning, relationships, and context.

### Key Capabilities

- **Semantic Understanding** - "spacious" matches "large rooms", "open concept", etc.
- **Multi-Domain Search** - Searches rooms, apartments, and neighborhoods simultaneously
- **Location Verification** - Validates claims like "near subway" using Google Maps
- **Multi-Modal Indexing** - Process text descriptions and images together
- **Claim Attribution** - Track which claims came from text vs images

### Technology Stack

- **Vector Search**: Elasticsearch with kNN
- **Embeddings**: Google Gemini (768 dimensions)
- **Vision**: Gemini Vision for image analysis
- **Maps**: Google Maps Grounding for location verification

---

## Core Concepts

### 1. Claim-Based Indexing

The system breaks down listings into **atomic claims** instead of storing raw text.

**Example Input:**
```
"Modern 2BR in Williamsburg. Hardwood floors, renovated kitchen. 
Pet-friendly building. Close to L train."
```

**Indexed as Claims:**
```json
[
  {"claim": "modern apartment", "domain": "apartment", "type": "condition"},
  {"claim": "2 bedroom", "domain": "apartment", "type": "size"},
  {"claim": "located in Williamsburg", "domain": "neighborhood", "type": "location"},
  {"claim": "hardwood floors", "domain": "apartment", "type": "features"},
  {"claim": "renovated kitchen", "domain": "room", "type": "condition"},
  {"claim": "pet-friendly", "domain": "apartment", "type": "policies"},
  {"claim": "close to L train", "domain": "neighborhood", "type": "transport"}
]
```

**Why?** Enables precise matching, better ranking, and faceted filtering.

### 2. Three-Domain Model

| Domain | Description | Examples |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Neighborhood** | Area characteristics, location, transport | "trendy area", "near subway", "in Brooklyn" |
| **Apartment** | Building/unit features, policies | "doorman", "renovated", "pets allowed", "2BR" |
| **Room** | Specific room features | "spacious kitchen", "walk-in closet" |

Different domains have different importance weights and are searched separately.

### 3. Claim Kinds

| Kind | Description | Weight Multiplier | Origin |
|------|-------------|-------------------|--------|
| `base` | Directly from listing | 1.0 | LLM extraction |
| `derived` | Semantic expansion | 0.75 | "spacious" ‚Üí "large", "roomy" |
| `anti` | Negation claims | 0.75 | "pet-friendly" ‚Üí "no pets allowed" |
| `verified` | Google Maps confirmed | 1.1 | Maps API verification |

### 4. Google Maps Grounding

Location-based claims can be verified with real Google Maps data.

**Unverified Claim:** "close to L train"  
**After Grounding:**
- ‚úÖ Verified: "529m to Bedford Ave L station"
- üìç Coordinates: `{lat: 40.7149, lng: -73.9566}`
- üó∫Ô∏è Widget token for interactive map
- ‚≠ê Place details (name, rating, photos)

**Benefits:**
- **Trust**: Real data, not just text
- **Precision**: Exact distances vs vague descriptions
- **UX**: Interactive maps users can explore

### 5. Multi-Modal Indexing

Apartments can be indexed with text descriptions AND images.

**Flow:**
1. Submit description + image URLs
2. Gemini Vision describes each image
3. Extract claims from all sources
4. Deduplicate similar claims
5. Index with source attribution

**Source Tracking:**
```json
{
  "claim": "white marble countertops",
  "domain": "room",
  "source": {
    "type": "image",
    "image_url": "https://...",
    "image_index": 0
  }
}
```

    "rooms": "rooms",
    "apartments": "apartments",
    "neighborhoods": "neighborhoods"
  }
}
```

---

### Index Apartment

```http
POST /api/index
Content-Type: application/json
```

Add or update an apartment listing with optional images.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "apartment_id": "apt_12345",
  "document": "Modern 2BR with hardwood floors...",
  "address": "123 Bedford Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11211",
  "neighborhood_id": "williamsburg",
  "image_urls": [
    "https://example.com/kitchen.jpg",
    "https://example.com/living-room.jpg"
  ]
}
```

**Parameters:**
- `apartment_id` (required) - Unique identifier
- `document` (optional) - Text description
- `address` (optional) - Full address for geocoding/grounding
- `neighborhood_id` (optional) - Neighborhood identifier
- `image_urls` (optional) - Array of publicly accessible image URLs

**Constraints:**
- At least one of `document` or `image_urls` required
- Supported image formats: JPG, PNG, WebP, GIF

## Google Maps Widgets

### What Are They?

Map widget tokens enable rendering **interactive Google Maps** showing verified locations. Instead of just text ("near coffee shops"), users see an actual map with markers they can explore.

### How to Get Them

Widget tokens are automatically included in search results when:
1. Query contains location-based claims
2. User location is provided
3. Google Maps verification succeeds

### Token Format

```json
{
  "map_widget_tokens": ["ChIJwxyz123..."]
}
```

Each token is a string that encodes:
- Map view (center, zoom)
- Place markers
- Place details (names, ratings, photos)

### Rendering Requirements

To display widgets, you need:
1. Google Maps JavaScript API loaded
2. Valid Google Maps API key
3. The `<gmp-place-contextual>` web component
4. Proper attribution to Google Maps

### Example Rendering

```html
<!-- Include Google Maps library -->
<script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_KEY&libraries=places"></script>

<!-- Render widget -->
<gmp-place-contextual context-token="ChIJwxyz123...">
</gmp-place-contextual>

<!-- Required attribution -->
<a href="https://maps.google.com" translate="no">Google Maps</a>
```

### Attribution Requirements

Per Google's terms, you must:
- Display "Google Maps" text (no modification)
- Use Roboto font or sans-serif fallback
- Font size: 12-16px
- Color: #1F1F1F (black) or #5E5E5E (gray)
- Add `translate="no"` attribute
- Link to maps.google.com

### Token Lifecycle

- **Valid for:** ~30 days
- **Caching:** Not recommended (ephemeral)
- **Cost:** Included in grounding call (no extra charge)

---

## Best Practices

### Query Construction

**Good Queries:**
- Natural language: "2BR with hardwood floors near subway in Brooklyn"
- Include details: "Modern studio with in-unit laundry, pet-friendly"
- Be specific: "Apartment near good coffee shops and parks under $3000"

**Avoid:**
- Too vague: "apt"
- Abbreviations: "2br hwf subway bk"
- All caps: "MODERN LUXURY PENTHOUSE"

### Handling Long Operations

**Indexing:**
- Takes 30-60 seconds
- Show progress indicator
- Don't block UI
- Provide cancel option

**Searching:**
- Usually <2 seconds
- Consider debouncing (wait 300ms after typing)
- Show loading state immediately
- Cache repeated queries

### Image URLs

**Requirements:**
- Must be publicly accessible (not localhost)
- Supported: JPG, PNG, WebP, GIF
- Recommended: 800px+ width
- File size: <5MB per image

**Tips:**
- Use CDN for better performance
- Consider image optimization
- Provide fallback for failed loads

### Error Handling

**Common Errors:**

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| 400 | Invalid request | Check parameters |
| 404 | Apartment not found | Verify ID exists |
| 500 | Server error | Retry or contact support |

**Indexing Failures:**
- Image fetch errors (check URLs)
- Vision API limits (wait and retry)
- Invalid address (geocoding fails)

**Search Failures:**
- No results (query too specific)
- Timeout (reduce top_k)
- Invalid location (check coordinates)

### Performance

**Search Optimization:**
- Cache results for identical queries
- Debounce search input
- Limit top_k to reasonable values (10-20)
- Consider pagination for large result sets

**Display Optimization:**
- Lazy load images
- Virtualize long lists
- Show results progressively
- Defer widget rendering until visible

### Security

**API Access:**
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement rate limiting
- Validate all inputs
- Sanitize displayed content

**Google Maps:**
- Restrict API key to your domain
- Monitor usage/costs
- Follow Google's terms of service

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Search

1. User enters query: "2BR near subway"
2. Call `POST /api/search` with query
3. Display results with scores
4. Show matched claims to explain ranking
5. Highlight verified claims with badges

### Scenario 2: Location-Aware Search

1. Get user's location via browser geolocation
2. Include in search request as `user_location`
3. Backend grounds claims relative to user
4. Results include geo-filtered apartments
5. Display distances from user location

### Scenario 3: Indexing with Images

1. User provides description + image URLs
2. Call `POST /api/index` with both
3. Show progress (30-60s wait)
4. Backend analyzes images in parallel
5. Display indexed features grouped by source
6. Show which claims came from which image

### Scenario 4: Admin/Database View

1. Call `GET /api/apartments` with pagination
2. Display grid/list of all apartments
3. Show thumbnail gallery for image_urls
4. Filter by `has_images=true` if needed
5. Implement pagination controls
6. Link to detail view for each apartment

### Scenario 5: Apartment Detail Page

1. Get apartment_id from URL/route
2. Call `GET /api/apartments/{id}`
3. Display full details
4. Group claims by domain
5. Highlight verified claims
6. Show image gallery
7. Display location on map

---

## Troubleshooting

### No Search Results

**Possible Causes:**
- No apartments indexed
- Query too specific
- Elasticsearch connection issue

**Solutions:**
1. Check if apartments exist: `GET /api/apartments`
2. Try broader query
3. Check backend logs

### Slow Indexing

**Expected:** 30-60s for text + 2 images

**If Slower:**
- Check backend logs for errors
- Verify image URLs are accessible
- Check Gemini API rate limits
- Network latency fetching images

### Widgets Not Showing

**Checklist:**
- ‚úÖ Google Maps JS library loaded?
- ‚úÖ Valid API key?
- ‚úÖ Token exists in response?
- ‚úÖ Correct web component used?
- ‚úÖ Attribution displayed?

### Images Not Analyzed

**Check:**
- URLs publicly accessible?
- Valid image format?
- Not timing out (large files)?
- Backend logs for vision API errors

## Quick Reference

### Endpoints

```
POST   /api/setup           - Initialize indices
POST   /api/index           - Index single apartment
POST   /api/index/batch     - Batch index apartments
POST   /api/search          - Search apartments
GET    /api/apartments      - List all apartments
GET    /api/apartments/:id  - Get apartment details
DELETE /api/apartments/:id  - Delete apartment
GET    /health              - Health check
```

### Key Concepts

- **Claims** - Atomic facts extracted from listings
- **Domains** - Neighborhood, Apartment, Room
- **Kinds** - Base, Derived, Anti, Verified
- **Grounding** - Google Maps verification of location claims
- **Multi-modal** - Text + Image analysis
- **Semantic** - Understanding meaning, not just keywords

### Score Ranges

- **0.8+** - Excellent match (show prominently)
- **0.6-0.8** - Good match (show normally)
- **0.4-0.6** - Partial match (show with caveats)
- **<0.4** - Weak match (consider hiding)

### Timing Expectations

- **Search:** 1-3 seconds
- **Indexing (text only):** 20-30 seconds
- **Indexing (text + images):** 30-60 seconds
- **Widget rendering:** Instant (after search)
