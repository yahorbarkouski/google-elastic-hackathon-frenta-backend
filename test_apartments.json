      "description": "Stay in a classic San Francisco Victorian home in Hayes Valley, just blocks from the Painted Ladies. Enjoy a spacious private room with queen bed, city views, and easy access to restaurants, bars, and transit. Prime Hayes Valley spot — central and walkable\nEasy access to Downtown, Golden Gate Park, Castro, and Mission District and Civic Center.\nBathroom just across the hall, Soaring high ceilings and classic Victorian character.  Enclosed back porch/sunroom and large shared living room.\n\nThe space\nThis very large Victorian Flat has very large rooms and 14 foot ceilings.   With 3 bathrooms in the house and your use of common space our guests just love staying here.\n\nGuest access\nGuests have use of all common spaces.  The kitchen is open from 7am to 7pm.   There is a TV room, living room, patio and kitchen all for use by our guests.\n\nDuring your stay\nI am around as much as I can but still have a full time job so busy and working most of the time.   I have an on-site person who also assist me with the home.\n\nOther things to note\nParking\n\nThere is street parking around the house.   Some metered and some Zone Parking:\n\nParking Meters\nMost meters have a two-hour time limit. They can be paid by coin, phone, or credit card.\n\nMeter rates vary by zone, with downtown and Fisherman's Wharf being the most expensive. Most are between $2.00 and $4.50 per hour.\n\nWith new \"smart\" technology, there are some SFpark areas based on demand, where rates incrementally adjust by quarter and can range from $0.50 to $6.50 per hour.\n\nHours of operation for most meters are 9am - 6pm Monday - Saturday. The meters in Fisherman's Wharf run from 7am - 7pm daily. Some of the meters in the busier areas and the Port of San Francisco run until 10 or 11pm. \n\nMost allow you to park without moving your car for 1 to 4 hours. After your time runs out, you are supposed to move your car to a new spot instead of just feeding the meter again. \n\nMost meters are NOT in effect on Sundays, except in the Fisherman's Wharf area, the Embarcadero, off-street parking lots, and the Special Events Area near Oracle Park. \n\nAll metered spots are free on Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, and New Year's Day. \n\nAfter you park, always read the meter to confirm days and hours of operation, time limits, and rates.\n\nOther Street Parking\nIf you find a parking spot on the street that is not metered, check to see if the curb is painted, and look for signs posted about time limits and street sweeping hours. \n\nMost areas of the city have parking permits for local residents. If you do not have a parking permit, you will only be allowed to park for a certain amount of time. Two hours is the standard although some are only one hour and some as much as three. Look for the signs near your car to find out the regulations for San Francisco parking on the street.\n\nHere are some other street parking guidelines: \n\nRed curb means no parking at anytime\nGreen curb is for short term parking only, usually around 10 minutes\nYellow curbs are loading and unloading zones for commercial vehicles\nWhite is passenger pick up and drop off only, with a time limit of around 5 minutes\nBlue is handicapped parking only with a valid permit\n\nRegistration Details\n2024-006496STR",

      "description": "Welcome! This private en-suite room is on the ground level of our remodeled 1916 Edwardian in the Inner Sunset neighborhood. We are 3 blocks from Golden Gate Park, the DeYoung museum, and the Academy of Sciences. Our neighborhood has many restaurants, stores and even a Sunday Farmer's market. We are also 3 blocks away, in the other direction, from UCSF. This is a perfect location!\n\nThe space\nThe room has a comfortable double bed, dresser, closet space, counter dining table with stools, and a private bathroom. The room is very quiet and has a large window overlooking the garden, which you are free to use. On the same level, just outside your room are two common areas that are for your use. There is a kitchenette area: sink, refrigerator, snacks, dishes, etc.  There's an electric kettle and microwave. The spacious backyard has a seating area solely for your use (we use an upstairs deck area). You can make tea and enjoy it outside in the sunshine! And be sure and visit our four chickens in the coop at the back of the garden.\n\nGuest access: There is an easy garage door key code. Walk through the garage to the back and enter your bedroom. Entirely private -- come as go as you like. We are flexible with check in and check out and willing to work with you or make suggestions for your visit. We try and be here to welcome you when you arrive.\n\nIf you have a third person, or your friend/child doesn't want to share the double bed, it is possible for us to set up a foam bed in the outer room for an additional charge.\n\nGuest access\nThere is an easy garage door key code. Walk through the garage to the back and enter your bedroom. Entirely private -- come as go as you like. We are flexible with check in and check out and willing to work with you or make suggestions for your visit. We try and be here to welcome you when you arrive.\n\nDuring your stay\nMy husband Jim, our dog Gatsby, and I will greet you and be upstairs during your stay. Please feel free to text us with anything! We're happy to help you with anything you need. We know SF and our neighborhood very well as we've lived in this house almost 20 years.\n\nOther things to note\nA note on CARS/PARKING:\nWe live in the city, so parking is tricky. That said, you really don't need a car. SF a very walk-able city; the public transportation is great; and Uber and Lyft are both headquartered here. In addition, Waymo -- the driverless cars -- are super fun and work just like the others, through an app. You just don't tip the driver! If you are renting a car, I strongly advise you to rent the car at the end of your stay. If you are doing a road trip and it's unavoidable to bring your car, there is street parking on the weekend. Otherwise, street parking is available, but you need to move your car every 2 hours.\n\nWe do not have parking, but can make our driveway available to you for a minimal fee. If you need to do this, please let us know when you book.\n\nRegistration Details\nSTR-0004882",

      "title": "Gorgeous period Victorian room in Noe Valley",
      "description": "Beautiful period-decorated bedroom in a well maintained 1890 Victorian home. Walk to the Mission, 24th St, BART, Muni, Dolores Park.\n\nYou have a beautiful, newly remodeled bath shared with one other room. Please forget your past experience of shared baths. Here, all shower shelves, towel bars and cabinets are labeled by room number, creating clear boundaries. Cleaning is regular and you'll likely never find other guests' mess in your way. It's highly organized - just see my reviews.\n\nThe space\nThe space itself is about 13 x 17 with huge bay windows and 10 foot ceilings. The window coverings are highly light blocking.\n\nThe bed is a Queen size with very comfortable mattress.  My guests frequently remark on the comfort of my mattresses.\n\nThere is a very comfortable reading nook with a Howard Elliot chair that cradles you for the perfect meditation or reading session.  You can also work or have coffee or meals by the window at the bistro table set up.\n\nShould you need faster speed than WiFi, there is also a gigabit speed Ethernet port and cable to connect to. While I do not have any televisions in the house, this should provide you with incredible streaming access on your laptop and your zoom meetings will be free of stutter and freeze up.  The cable also reaches the bistro table so you can sit by the window and enjoy watching the street life while you Zoom.\n\nThe (faux but original) fireplace is backlit through stained glass I added to produce a wonderful nightlight ambiance.\n\nThe double wide antique armoire offers ample drawer and hanging space for most guests, and for those staying longer, closet space across the hall may be available as well.\n\nThis has been my own room for many years but I have recently moved upstairs to a new room I just updated.  Two items to consider are the fact that this room is in the front of the house and also not far from the kitchen.  If you are bothered by the  moderate noise of life it may not be a good fit.  I always found the close access to the kitchen very convenient while working from home!\n\nGuest access\nYou have a designated bath, which is very new and of hotel quality, shared with only one other room, If it is occupied when you need it in a hurry, you may use either of the two other baths on the next floor, though if possible, please try to use your designated bathroom for longer activities such as showering.\n\nMy excellent reviews (see my other listings by clicking on my profile picture) reflect the fact that you will almost always find the baths sparkling clean despite their shared status. I do a lot of work from home and make it a point to check in on all bathrooms at various times during the day and touch them up as needed. Importantly, they are organized to show room numbers on towel bars, shelves, drawers, etc. so as to maintain clear boundaries with the other room using the bath. The automated vent fans are also very strong, with over-sized ducts to keep the air clean at all times. I aim to provide you a near hotel quality stay - the shared bath should feel almost like your own.\n\nYou also have access to the kitchen which houses your own designated refrigerator (identified by a room number is on the front of each refrigerator) and cabinet space for dry goods, similarly numbered. The kitchen has counter seats for eating or hanging out and talking to people while they cook.\n\nThere is also a laundry room off the kitchen with detergent available. No coins are necessary; it is no extra charge. Feel free to ask about how to use the machines. Detergent, an iron and ironing board and water spray bottle are also found there.\n\nAll necessary information to access any of this as well as the house itself will be sent in a message after you book. My reviews also frequently mention the value and clarity of the information you'll receive to enjoy the house.\n\nFinally, for guests who are arriving in the city well before check-in time, or departing the city significantly after check-out time, I have a closet to hold your bags while you savor a few bonus hours in my fair city.\n\nDuring your stay\nWhile I am around the house most of the time, I will send you very explicit instructions for unassisted check in at whatever hour you arrive. Doubtless, we will pass in the hall or in the kitchen but you needn't feel compelled to interact with me unless you have questions or want to know more about the house's history, etc.  I do adore talking to my guests when they are open to it. \n\nI work from home most of the time, so I am mostly available for instant answers or fixes if something is malfunctioning. (I have a complete wood shop/tool shop in the basement for almost any kind of repairs)\n\nOther things to note\nIf you are bringing a car, let me know if you plan to leave the car parked without moving it for more than half a day at a time.  Parking is free but can be time limited without a residential permit.  I can have such temporary permits available at the cost charged by the city. I usually have some in inventory of day permits but the more I know about your plans, the better choices I can offer you.  I also sometimes have an off street parking space available depending on demand.\n\nRegistration Details\nSTR-0003573",

High ceilings throughout, and large open spaces give this house a light and open feel.\n\nA friendly dog sometimes lives at the property.\n\nThe space\nMy family home was designed by local artists. From the antique-car-hood awning to the San Francisco Hyde Street Cable Car hand railing in the stairs, every feature is unique.\n\nMy place is a sanctuary away from the noise, pollution and hustle of downtown. It's convenient for the airport, has easy parking and yet you can be downtown in 15 minutes. My place is great for couples.\n\nMy home is best for visitors with a car, or using Uber, Lyft or Taxis. Public transit is possible but slow from my home.\n\nMy street is a dead end street with almost no traffic. The other houses are all long time families and homeowners, and is very safe. There are nice restaurants a short drive away.\n\nWe use 100% renewable electricity.\n\nGuest access\nYour room is on the third floor which is the main living level. It has its own private bathroom with walk in shower and large bathtub. You are also welcome to use our living space, dining space, kitchen, porch, and laundry room. You are expected to clean up and put away in the kitchen after yourself. There will be additional charges for any kitchen cleaning left after meals, $20/half hour. You will be sharing these communal spaces with other airbnb tenants and myself.\n\nDuring your stay\nI tend to be busy, so may not see you much during your stay.\n\nWe do have another listing for the guest bedroom, so you may find other travelers staying in our home at the same time as you.\n\nOther things to note\nWe have a friendly German Shepherd dog, and a cat that sometimes stay at this property. Throw Willa's ball and you'll have a best friend for life. Please note we do not allow smoking anywhere on the property or outside, nor do we want guests who smell of smoke.\n\nRegistration Details\n2022-005766STR",
